                    <li>Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel (31 October 1875 – 15 December 1950), popularly known as Sardar
                        Patel, was an Indian politician.</li>
                    <li>He served as the first Deputy Prime Minister of India. He was an
                        Indian
                        barrister, a senior leader of the Indian National Congress and a founding father of the Republic
                        of
                        India</li>
                    <li>He played a leading role in the country's struggle for independence and guided its
                        integration into a united, independent nation. In India and elsewhere</li>
                    <li>he was often called Sardar,
                        meaning
                        "chief" in Hindi, Urdu, and Persian. He acted as Home Minister during the political integration
                        of
                        India and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.</li>
                    <li>Patel was born in Nadiad and raised in the countryside of the state of Gujarat. He was a
                        successful lawyer.</li>
                    <li>He subsequently organised peasants from Kheda, Borsad, and Bardoli in Gujarat in
                        non-violent
                        civil disobedience against the British Raj, becoming one of the most influential leaders in
                        Gujarat.</li>
                    <li>He was appointed as the 49th President of Indian National Congress, organising the party for
                        elections
                        in 1934 and 1937 while promoting the Quit India Movement.</li>
                    <li>As the first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of India, Patel organised relief efforts
                        for
                        refugees fleeing to Punjab and Delhi from Pakistan and worked to restore peace.</li>
                    <li>He led the task of
                        forging a united India, successfully integrating into the newly independent nation those British
                        colonial provinces that had been "allocated" to India. Besides those provinces that had been
                        under direct British rule, approximately 565 self-governing princely states had been released
                        from
                        British
                        suzerainty by the Indian Independence Act of 1947. Patel persuaded almost every princely state
                        to
                        accede to India.</li>
                    <li>His commitment to national integration in the newly independent country was total
                        and
                        uncompromising, earning him the sobriquet "Iron Man of India".</li>
                    <li>He is also remembered as the
                        "patron saint of India's civil servants" for having established the modern all-India services
                        system.</li>
                    <li>He is
                        also called the "Unifier of India". The Statue of Unity, the world's tallest statue, was
                        dedicated to
                        him on 31 October 2018 which is approximately 182 metres in height.</li>
